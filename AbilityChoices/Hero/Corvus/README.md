### Corvus
- Continuous Spells (Spear, Aggression, Malevolence, Storm)
  - No longer have an upfront mana cost
  - When disabled due to not enough mana, will automatically reenable when enough mana is regained
  - Red Choice - Full power of effect, but increased recurring mana cost to compensate for no upfront cost
  - Blue Choice - Same recurring mana cost, but reduced power of effect to compensate for no upfront cost 
- Instant Spells (Repel, Echo, Haste, Trample, Frostbound, Ember, Ancestral Might, Overload, Nourishment, Vision)
  - Now behave like Continuous Spells (also auto re-enable and have no upfront cost)
  - Red Choice - Full power of effect, increased recurring mana cost to compensate for 100% uptime potential
  - Blue Choice - Same recurring mana cost, but reduce power of effect to compensate for 100% uptime potential
- Special Behaviors
  - Trample summons horses that follow the spirit rather than sending them and the spirit along the track
  - Overload no longer makes the spirit disappear, but makes less powerful explosions to compensate (red choice does medium explosions every 10 seconds, blue does small explosions every second)
  - Nourishment just has a Red choice for passively sacrificing 13 mana per second
  - Vision's blue choice does not strip camo but still gives sight
  - Soul Barrier functions normally, but it's one red choice will make it automatically be used if a leak happens
