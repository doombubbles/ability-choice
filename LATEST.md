- Fixed many Red Icon affects that've been broken by recent BTD6 internal changes
  - This is mainly the income generating and trasnforming related ones
- Fixed both Spike Factory Effects
- Also finished off giving Blue Icon effects to all middle paths that didn't already have them 
  - Added a Blue Icon choice to Transforming Tonic for whether he looks like the monster or not
  - Added a Blue Icon choice to Artillery Battery for permanently gaining the blast radius increase of the Bombardment ability
  - Turned the current Ice Monkey Red Icon effects into Blue Icon effects. The new Red Icon effects are about periodically freezing all Bloons on screen for a short duration.
