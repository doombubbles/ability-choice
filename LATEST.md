- Fixed for BTD6 v50, Ability Choices for Silas will be added in a subsequent mod update
- Adjusted Blue Mode Biohack to slightly reduce the attack speed of the affected tower at lower levels
    - This is still likely going to be stronger than the base version, just no longer by quite as much
- Fixed an issue with Red Mode Take Aim sometimes becoming non permanent when loading a save
- Improved the interval handling for Red Mode Super Monkey Fan Club, so there will be no alternation of which dart
  monkeys are affected, and ability cooldown reduction can increase the number of affected dart monkeys
