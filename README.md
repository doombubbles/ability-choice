<h1 align="center">Ability Choice</h1>


BTD6 Abilities are fun and interactive, definitely, but sometimes you just don't feel like using them. This mod gives
you a choice: use the ability of a tower like normal, or give it up to instead give the base tower new effects.

Adds in 1-2 new choices for towers with abilities that you can pick instead of having an active ability, now selected in the Upgrades menu for the tower by Right-Clicking on the Upgrade.

Yellow Icon: Default Effect

Red Icon: Permanent but weaker effect of the ability

Blue Icon (Not All Towers): A new different effect based on the theme of the upgrade/path

## See [Here](AbilityChoices/README.md#all-ability-choices) for the full list of effects.
