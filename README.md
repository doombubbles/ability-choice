# Ability Choice

## NOTE: This alpha version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0, see [here](https://github.com/doombubbles/BTD6-Mods#readme) for the stable mods

BTD6 Abilities are fun and interactive, definitely, but sometimes you just don't feel like using them. This mod gives
you a choice: use the ability of a tower like normal, or give it up to instead give the base tower new effects.

Adds in two new choices for towers with abilities that you can pick instead of having an active ability, now selected in the Upgrades menu for the tower by Right-Clicking on the Upgrade. 

Yellow Icon: Default Effect 

Red Icon: Permanent but weaker effect of the ability 

Blue Icon: A new effect base on the theme of the upgrade path

Examples:

Plasma Monkey Fan Club
